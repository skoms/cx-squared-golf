# {cx}Â² | Golf Tournament Updates (Coding Test)

## Description

This is a demo project made according to instructions and resources given to me by CX-Squared. The task was to simply make a website that updates real-time utilizing Socket.io and presenting received data in a table.

## Main Languages/Technologies used:

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- React with Redux
- Socket IO

## Extra Features

- Sorting Feature: Sort by certain data like Update Time(default), and select order of which to order them, in the back its all either 'ASC' or 'DESC', but displayed in a manner that makes more sense to the user depending on data to sort by.
- Clear Table: This is just a very simple but useful way to empty the table, this could be useful for people who don't like larger tables.
- "Go back to top"-button: Takes you back to the top, very useful if you'd like to keep a long list but still get to navigate conveniently.
