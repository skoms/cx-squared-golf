# {cx}Â² | Golf Tournament Updates (Coding Test)

## Description

This is a demo project made according to instructions and resources given to me by CX-Squared. The task was to simply make a website that updates real-time utilizing Socket.io and presenting received data in a table.

## Main Languages/Technologies used:

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- React with Redux
- Socket IO

## Extra Features

- Sorting Feature: Sort by certain data like Update Time(default), and select order of which to order them, in the back its all either 'ASC' or 'DESC', but displayed in a manner that makes more sense to the user depending on data to sort by.
- Clear Table: This is just a very simple but useful way to empty the table, this could be useful for people who don't like larger tables.
- "Go back to top"-button: Takes you back to the top, very useful if you'd like to keep a long list but still get to navigate conveniently.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

   ```
   https://github.com/skoms/cx-squared-golf.git
   ```

2. Navigate to folder and install

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start application

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. (Situational) If it did not automatically open the browser for you, please open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000/

## Future Features

This is a list of features that I would be looking to implement to build on this application

1. Search Feature: Add a search bar so one could query through the data looking for certain statistics.

2. Additional Information Dropdown: Add a dropdown to each and every row of data to expand the information shown for that specific match. For example to have a mini-table in the dropdown, where We'd have Two rows: 1. Hole: 1 | 2 | --- | 18, and 2. which would show the data for that hole, per hole we'd show strokes and STP(strokes to pair) data.

3. Data Expansion: Expand the data received to receive data from a whole range of golf tournaments globally, where one can filter and choose which updates to get.

4. Expansion: Instead of having a website intended to only show live updates, we could expand it. It could have several main sections like: Live Updates(The current one), Tournament Standings(A live Tournament Standings Table that would update the table with the current Standings for a selected Tournament), Tournament Results(Results from already finished tournaments in the past), and a player look-up system(Where one can browse the statistics and profile for each golf professional, introduction, demographics, history, achievements and more).

The opportunities are truly endless!
